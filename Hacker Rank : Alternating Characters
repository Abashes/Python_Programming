Solution:

#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

# Complete the 'alternatingCharacters' function below.
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
# The function accepts STRING s as parameter.

def alternatingCharacters(s):
    # Write your code here
    s = str(s)
    string_list = []
    count = 0
    for chars in s:
        string_list.append(chars)
    for indexes in range(1,len(string_list)):
        if string_list[indexes] == string_list[indexes-1]:
            count+=1
    return count

if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')
    q = int(input().strip())
    for q_itr in range(q):
        s = input()
        result = alternatingCharacters(s)
        fptr.write(str(result) + '\n')

    fptr.close()
